title: "SOP/PMS Gap is now really a percentage"
type: fix
description: 
  Changed computation of "Gap" fields so the result will be percentage (e.g. 13% instead of 0.13). The following script can be used to fix existing SOP/PMS.
  ```sql
  UPDATE production_sop_line SET sop_manuf_gap = sop_manuf_gap*100;
  UPDATE production_sop_line SET sop_sales_gap = sop_sales_gap*100;
  UPDATE production_sop_line SET sop_stock_gap = sop_stock_gap*100;
  ```
